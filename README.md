I'm a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in software development, honed through academic and professional experiences. I graduated from Brigham Young University Idaho in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and have since been dedicated to advancing my skills and contributing to impactful projects.

## Professional Journey
From October 2023 to May of 2025 I was working as a Software Test Engineer, focusing on modeling software used by government contractors to help ensure national security. Starting in the second half of May 2025 I have shifted into a development role. These roles have allowed me to engage deeply with various aspects of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and Agile methodologies. My work supports defense contracting, a field I am deeply committed to due to its vital role in national safety and well-being.

In addition to my full-time role, I am also developing a personal software project aimed at helping individuals better manage their finances. This project reflects my interest in creating practical, user-friendly solutions that address real-world challenges.

## Skills and Expertise
	â€¢	Programming Languages: Python is my forte, but I am continuously working toward expanding my knowledge base.
	â€¢	Software Development Lifecycle: Experienced in multiple stages of SDLC, from planning and design to testing and deployment.
	â€¢	Agile Methodology: Well-versed in Agile practices, ensuring efficient and adaptive project management.
	â€¢	Teamwork and Collaboration: I have worked on diverse teams, from military squads to development teams, always learning and adapting to new environments.

## Personal Projects and Learning
I am constantly seeking to improve my skills through self-study and online courses from platforms like Codecademy, DataCamp, and Udemy. I believe in lifelong learning and am currently looking at which Masters program will best add to my skills and experience.

## Values and Aspirations
My career is driven by a desire to contribute to the defense sector, inspired by the veterans in my family who instilled in me a strong sense of duty and service. Looking ahead, I aspire to possibly start my own business in the defense industry, providing innovative solutions and services.

In my daily routine, I prioritize personal growth and balance, dedicating time to study and family responsibilities. These practices ground me and fuel my dedication to my professional and personal endeavors.
